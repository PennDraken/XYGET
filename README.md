## What is XYGET?
XYGET is a simple program written in C# which is made to get the coordinates of all black/ white pixels of an image. It was made because I couldn't find any similar programs.

## How to install
In it's current state there is unfortuneatly not an easy way to install, although you have access to the source code here.

## Known bugs
- Progress bar not working
- Slow conversion on really big files

## Planned features
- Video importing/ exporting
- Export as .txt file
- User templates for how to format code (for quicker implementation into projects)
- Nearest neighbour interpolation when loading image (for the aesthetics)
